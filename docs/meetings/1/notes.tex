\section{Social contract and Responsibilities}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ambition

    \item All members should be kept up-to-date on our progress
    \item All members should feel they have responsibility and are contributing to the project
\end{enumerate}

\section{Domain model}

Comments: \begin{enumerate}
    \item We consider Rovers to be instances of Robots
    \item Sensors and actuators are parts of a robot
    \item The environment is sort of the whole model, so in a way everything is connected to it (Could be converted to Area and removed)
    \item Operators (both technical and non-technical), - Not yet defined 
    \item Missions and robots can coupled by an assignment (Not defined wether or not a mission owns a mission or the other way around)
    \item Networking device - Connects the central station and the robot.
    \item Reward points are stored/calculated in the central station for each robot according to the procedure as well as robot location.
    \item Procedure 
\end{enumerate} 

NOTE: Check aggregation and so forth with networking devices, sensors, and actuators.
