    \item Actor: Control Station
    \item Goal: Switch the current point calculation procedure according to their definition.
    \item Description: In order to fairly reward points based on the robots' location within physical and logical areas, two separate procedures are used. When the control station realises the conditions for switching the reward procedure are met, it signals the robots in order for them to know that the procedure was updated.
