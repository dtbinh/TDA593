Any Deltas that might appear during the formation of the component diagram:

\subsection*{Domain updates}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generalise wheels to be only actuators so as to encompass all things like motors, odometers, etc.
    \item Move strategy calculation to control station in Use Case "Calculate Strategy".
    \item Reward points should not be connected to the robot since it is no longer aware of them in our current design.
    \item The robot should no longer be aware of the Point Strategy since the points are now calculated in the control station.
    \item The robot no longer knows about the mission since the entire calculation is done from the side of the control station.
    \item Typo fixed: a robot is only connected to a single networking device.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Use-case Updates}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use Case - Assign Mission - Change robot reference to control station since the strategies are calculated there now.
    \item Use-Case - Calculate Strategy - Calculation is now done in the control station.
    \item Use-Case - Reward Points - Change any assumptions of individual point tracking - points are a sum as of now. An assumption is made that the point counter will be periodically reset - ex. weekly.
    \item Use-Case - Update Procedure - the robot should not know about the procedure anymore since the control station handles everything that has to do with points. 
\end{enumerate}
