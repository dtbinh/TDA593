\section{Control station}
\subsection{Sender}
The Sender receives dispatch instructions from either the Conductor or directly from the Action Handler and dispatches this to a Robot.
\subsection{Receiver}
The Receiver receives information related to a Robot. It stores this in the Robot Tracker.
\subsection{Strategy Planner}
Uses the Robot Tracker to calculate certain strategies. Dispatches an instructions to the Communication Device
\subsection{Input Provider}
Receives input from the actors interface (Mission/Strategy). Provides details on which Mission and Strategy the Conductor will use to decide the instruction
\subsection{Point Rewarder}
Component to decide when points are rewarded, sends these points forward to the user interface
\subsection{Robot Tracker}
Receives information from the Communication Device, stores all data related to the Robots. Relays data to Point Rewarder, Info Provider, and Strategy Planner
\subsection{Conductor}
Takes different kinds of inputs and conducts which instruction should be applied to a robot.
\subsection{Info provider}
Sends information such as points collected by the robots to the Interface

\section{Robot}
\subsection{GPS}
Separate component, connected to the robot subsystem. Connected to an interface "Location" which requires methods to provide the information from the GPS to the Robot Controller class.
\subsection{Proximity}
Separate component, connected to the robot subsystem. Connected to an interface "Distance" which requires methods to provide the data from the Proximity sensor to the Robot Controller class.
\subsection{Camera}
Separate component, connected to the robot subsystem. Connected to an interface "Stream" which requires methods to provide the data from the Camera to the Robot Controller class.
\subsection{Actuators}
Separate component. Connected to the robot subsystem through an interface "Movement". Requires methods to provide movement actions for the robot itself.
\subsection{Networking device}
Singular interface for dispatching and receiving data between the Control Station (Package delivery/recipient). NOTE: This is to be connected to something that handles the data.

\subsection{Controller}
Brain of the robot.

\section{Interface}
\subsection{Display}
Component to display certain information and provide a graphical way to initiate robots through some functionality.
\subsection{Action button}
A way to dispatch emergent actions (such as emergency stop for example).
\subsection{Mission Composer}
A graphical way to select combinations of options for missions and strategies.
