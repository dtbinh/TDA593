- Class diagram:
    - Sensor could be Sensor-controller to be more descriptive since he thought it would be one sensor as it looks now.
    - Could have had the Interfaces be interfaces which also has classes implementing them.
    - More specific name such as orderingPoint instead of strategy. For context purpose. Make it more concrete
    - Maybe not update expected to be in procedure interface. rename to nextProcedure? Move the method to the point rewarder? 
    - Point rewarded does more than it promises with the calculate... Look at it from the point of view from a maintainer. Rename to run? implementing runnable. Main issue is the method naming.
    - Good structure, well worked out.
